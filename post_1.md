# Getting the Fuck out of Teaching

## The world of teaching

As a young idealistic student planning my future career I told myself I could never work in a corporate environment. How could I give up my time to line someone else's pockets? Should I not being doing something to give back to the world? It was with this in mind I decided to become a maths teacher. I had some experience tutoring people and I had always dreamed of being a teacher, as it turns out achieving your dreams isn't all it's made out to be sometimes.

To put it simply teaching is a horrendous profession at the moment. I don't buy into the myth that kids are getting worse or that technology is rotting their brains. Instead I think a combination of a lack of funding, poor working conditions and performance related pay were to blame for many of the issues that I saw. Inadequate funding meant that I often saw decisions being made not based on what would be best for learning but what would be cheapest. The working environment was shoddy at best and it was only on leaving teaching that I realized that people could actually be positive and happy about turning up for work.

Most of all for me though, the performance related pay was destroyed my teaching career. It really came to a head during my last year when I had to argue with my head teacher for a pay rise after getting results that put my class in the top 25% in the country. Even as I type this though I realised how stupid it is that I think of them as "my results". I didn't sit the exam, the students did, and it was their hard work (or lack of) that brought about their results. Trying telling most teacher's that they don't make that much impact on a student's attainment though.

## Path to tech
I hated the profession I had ended up in. Like most people probably but I had that the misfortune of school years counting up, students getting older and and summer holidays reminding me how much of my life I had sunk into them. The question was, what should I do instead? I didn't feel like I could do anything else and thought I had no transferrable skills. I had been learning programming in my spare time at home as a hobby for little projects but I knew I was way off being employable. Coincidently, I presented an assembly on the idea of growth mindset. The idea being that your ability/knowledge/understanding isn't fixed, but can be changed and improved through hard work. 

Now, I'm not sure it says much about my presentation skills, but this had no impact on the students I taught. It did affect me though. I inspired myself to learn the skills I needed to get out of teaching. Inpiration was the first step but I actually had to decide what to learn. Which language should I learn? Did I need a degree? Would someone actually hire me at the end? There was a plethora of blog posts, twitter converstations and subreddits devoted to answer these questions, which actually made answering these questions pretty difficult.

In about eighteen months from that descion being made I managed to get my first job as a developer. To minimize my rambling, I think I can pin my success in getting hired on two things, CS50 and networking. [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) is the popular online computer science course from Harvard University. I can't quite describe how good the lecturer for the course, David Malan, is so stop reading and watch some of this [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9Eds2Rc_x8). The amount he sweats really shows how commited he is to his craft and I learnt a lot of about not just programming but also teaching too. The second part of becomming a programmer was networking and more specificaly meet-ups. The ability to talk to people who are actually doing the job you want to do is invauable. I also got to ask for help, tips on best practices and actually people to look at the code I was writing and tell me it was alright!

This all sounds positive so far, but I don't want to give the impression it was easy. Working a full-time job, learning programming and trying to be at least slightly sociable was a challenge that involved a consistent lack of sleep and far few breakdowns on the journey. I remember talking to some teachers about at work about how I felt like I was constantly on the verge of tears on a fairly regular basis and being suprised that it was a fairly command senitment across the team. So with the day to day pain of teaching keeping me driven, I kept going.

Lots of learning, projects and meetups later I felt like I was getting close. I was really keen to know how much more I needed to do to start applying for jobs. The problem with being self-taught it there is no-one there to tell you when you are done. So I started asking around for work experience, specifcally from Lush as some of their developers ran the meetup I had been going to. They were brilliant and I started to arrange to do a couple of weeks during my school holidays. In the end it fell through so instead they sent me the coding task they normally give to interview candidates. It turns out I was more ready than I thought as instead of work experience they offered me an interview which resulted in me getting the job!

## My first two Months

Within the first week I was amazed by the difference in enviorment between the teaching proffesion and working in technology. In the first meeting I sat in people praised each other and there were straight conversations about what was working and what needed to change. The office is a fabulous place to work with a view over the ocean, lots of greeney and free coffee (not a thing in education). 

My biggest concern before I started was that I was going to be found out as secretly a crap programmer. That in the first week I would be stumped by an "easy" task and get fired on the spot. Clearly this didn't happen but it was a genuine concern. I also had the same imposter syndrome problem as a teacher. That someone would walk into my lessons and tell the class they had been taught by a fraud. The crazy thing is in Lush people were actually upfront about having the same issues. Also, the postitivity and praise really helps to reassure myself that I was doing a good job.
